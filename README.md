### Project 
- p1: shell implementation (`mumsh`)
    - style: solo-project
    - codebase: null
    - evaluation: JOJ test required for correctness
    - coverage: c-programing, string parsing, shell features, interprocess communication, IO, etc.
- p2: multi-threading database implementation (`Lemonion::lemonDB`)
    - style: 1+2 team-project
    - codebase: provided code template
    - evaluation: JOJ test required for correctness and efficiency
    - coverage: cpp-programming, string parsing, multi-threading, etc.
- p3: Minix3 scheduler implementation (`CoolZone::Minix3`)
    - style: 1+2 team-project
    - codebase: provided Minix3 source code
    - evaluation: project demonstration required for functionality and performance
    - coverage: c-kernel-programming, os debugging, scheduling, etc.

## Honor Code
If there is similar course materials assigned in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, or MD/PDF files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository doesn't take any commitment for other's faults.
