The POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standards encompass a set of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) guidelines that establish a standardized interface to ensure compatibility across diverse operating systems. POSIX's primary objective is to foster interoperability among Unix-like and POSIX-compliant operating systems. These standards address several key goals including compatibility, portability, consistency, and open standards, enabling developers to create software that can be easily adapted and deployed across various systems.

The POSIX standards encompass a broad spectrum of topics concerning operating systems and system programming. Key components and regulations incorporated in the POSIX standards include file system interfaces, process control, shell and utilities, threads, networking, time and date handling, user and group management, error handling, and real-time systems. These standards ensure that software developed in accordance with POSIX guidelines can be easily adapted and deployed on various Unix-like systems, making them an invaluable resource for developers, system administrators, and organizations relying on interoperable and portable software solutions.
